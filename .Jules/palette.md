## 2025-05-15 - Accessible Service Modals
**Learning:** Interactive elements implemented as divs (like cards) must have role="button", tabindex="0", and keyboard listeners (Enter/Space) to be accessible. Modals require dialog roles, focus management (focusing the close button on open and restoring focus on close), and Escape key support.
**Action:** Always implement focus management and ARIA roles when creating custom modal interactions.
